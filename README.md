HOGE community-driven website.

Your 2 main workhorses are [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

For development you will need [React basics](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) and [Tailwind basics](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first). (Their docs are really good, just search for anything you don't know how to do)

Once you're happy you need to know [how to make a pull request](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-make-your-first-pull-request-on-github-3/)

To get spun up locally simply clone project, `npm install`, `npm start`
